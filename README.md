Game Closure Image Format

This is a Work-In-Progress towards a new RGBA image format that works well for
our spritehseets.

It is expected to produce files about half the size of the equivalent PNG
formatted images.  And it is expected to decompress three times faster than the
equivalent PNG formatted image (with PNGCRUSH) using libpng.

Specification
=============

Starting from the BCIF spec we decided to make some improvements.

To optimize for low decompression time, we restricted ourselves to considering
only the fastest compression primitives: Filtering, LZ, and static Huffman.

BCIF does filtering and static Huffman coding, but left out LZ, which we feel
is a mistake since LZ is great for representing repeated data patterns, which
can be encoded byte-wise, reducing the number of Huffman symbols to decode.
In our tests, adding an LZ step improves compression ratio and decomp speed.

BCIF is also not designed for an alpha channel, and our games require alpha
for sprite-sheets.  Furthermore, our images tend to have a lot of
fully-transparent pixels that indicate 1-bit alpha is a good approach.
So we developed a monochrome compressor that outperforms PNG just for the alpha
channel.  Pixels that are represented by this monochrome bitmask can be skipped
during the rest of the RGBA decoding, so the overall performance is improved.

We also decided to rewrite BCIF from scratch after understanding how it worked,
since we found that the code could be significantly improved in decompression
speed, and we also disagreed with some of the finer points of the algorithm.


### Step 0. Fully-Transparent Pixel Encoding

Fully-transparent pixels are combined into a monochrome raster and a filter is
applied to each pixel:

For the first row:

+ If the pixel to the left is "on", then we predict the pixel is "on."

For other rows:

+ If the pixel above it is "on", then we predict the pixel is "on."
+ If the two pixels to the left are "on", then we predict the pixel is "on."

Whenever the filter fails to predict properly, a 1 bit is written.

The distance between these 1 bits is encoded for each row.
We tried delta-encoding the distances in x and y but did not see improvement.

For each scanline: {number of distances recorded} {list of distances...}
This is encoded as a byte stream, which is then LZ compressed with LZ4HC.

Static Huffman entropy encoding is then performed for further compression.

Pixels that are fully-transparent are skipped over during encoding/decoding.


### Step 1. 2D LZ

A custom 2D LZ77 algorithm is run to find repeated rectangular regions in the
image.  A rolling hash is used to do initial lookups on 3x3 regions, which is
the minimum size allowed for a match.  Hash collisions are checked, and then
matches are expanded.

If the resulting matches are accepted, they exclude further matches from
overlapping with them.  This approach gets RLE for free.  Each rectangular
region takes 10 bytes to represent, which is then compressed with Huffman
encoding and written to the file.  The resulting overhead is close to 5.5 bytes
per zone.


### Step 2. Filtering

Spatial and color filters are applied to the input data in 4x4 pixel blocks as
in BCIF.  The pair of filters that best estimate each block are chosen, as
measured by the L1 norm of the resulting pixel color component values, with 0
and 255 being the best result, and numbers around 128 being the worst.

The two filters are spatial and color.  The spatial filters are:

~~~
 Filter inputs:
         E
 F C B D
   A ?

	// In the order they are applied in the case of a tie:
	SF_Z,			// 0
	SF_D,			// D
	SF_C,			// C
	SF_B,			// B
	SF_A,			// A
	SF_AB,			// (A + B)/2
	SF_BD,			// (B + D)/2
	SF_CLAMP_GRAD,	// CBloom: 12: ClampedGradPredictor
	SF_SKEW_GRAD,	// CBloom: 5: Gradient skewed towards average
	SF_PICK_LEFT,	// New: Pick A or C based on which is closer to F
	SF_PRED_UR,		// New: Predict gradient continues from E to D to current
	SF_ABC_CLAMP,	// A + B - C clamped to [0, 255]
	SF_PAETH,		// Paeth filter
	SF_ABC_PAETH,	// If A <= C <= B, A + B - C, else Paeth filter
	SF_PL,			// Use ABC to determine if increasing or decreasing
	SF_PLO,			// Offset PL
	SF_ABCD,		// (A + B + C + D + 1)/4
	SF_AD,			// (A + D)/2
~~~

And the color filters are:

~~~
	// In order of preference (based on entropy scores from test images):
	CF_GB_RG,	// from BCIF
	CF_GR_BG,	// from BCIF
	CF_YUVr,	// YUVr from JPEG2000
	CF_D9,		// from the Strutz paper
	CF_D12,		// from the Strutz paper
	CF_D8,		// from the Strutz paper
	CF_E2_R,	// Derived from E2 and YCgCo-R
	CF_BG_RG,	// from BCIF (recommendation from LOCO-I paper)
	CF_GR_BR,	// from BCIF
	CF_D18,		// from the Strutz paper
	CF_B_GR_R,	// A decent default filter
	CF_D11,		// from the Strutz paper
	CF_D14,		// from the Strutz paper
	CF_D10,		// from the Strutz paper
	CF_YCgCo_R,	// Malvar's YCgCo-R
	CF_GB_RB,	// from BCIF
~~~

This generates encoded pixels and a filter description.  The filter description
is compressed with Huffman encoding and written to the file.


### Step 3. Chaos Context Encoding

For each RGB plane, the BCIF "chaos" metric is used to sort each remaining
filtered pixel into one of 8 bins.  Symbol statistics are collected for each
bin and each RGB plane.


### Step 4. Interleaved Encoding

Then each pixel is iterated over and alpha-masked or LZ-masked pixels are
omitted.  The pixels are Huffman encoded based on color plane and chaos metric.


What works right now
====================

The codec supports full RGBA.  The compressor and decompressor are close to
being finished:  The first image scanline decodes properly.

The code is well-written in our opinion, easy to read and adapt, and easy to
incorporate into mobile development.

We plan to release a Java version for the encoder after the RGBA compression is
functional in C++ code, so that the encoder can be run on any platform without
having to compile it.  The decoder will be split off so that only a minimal
amount of code needs to be added to support this file format.  We're shooting
for one large C++ file, though it may end up being a small number of files.


Stay tuned! =) -cat
