/*
 * Game Closure RGBA Decompression
 *
 * The decompressor rebuilds the static Huffman tables generated by the encoder
 * and then iterates over each pixel from upper left to lower right.
 * Where the Dominant Color mask is set, it emits a pixel of that color.
 *
 * For the remaining pixels, the BCIF "chaos" metric selects which Huffman
 * tables to use, and filtered pixel values are emitted.  The YUV color data is
 * then reversed to RGB and then the spatial filter is reversed back to the
 * original RGB data.
 *
 * LZ and alpha masking are very cheap decoding operations.  The most expensive
 * per-pixel operation is the static Huffman decoding, which is just a table
 * lookup and some bit twiddling for the majority of decoding.  As a result the
 * decoder is exceptionally fast.  It reaches for the Pareto Frontier.

	 * RGBA LZ Escape Bitstream Format
	 *
	 * Attached to the Y channel of the YUV encoder output are a number of
	 * extra "escape codes" that cause the decoder to go into an LZ decoding
	 * mode for the next few bits.
	 *
	 *
	 * Nice features of this format:
	 *
	 * (1) Include "same as last 1-4 distance" code and use it as often as possible.
	 *
	 * (2) Use most common 2D distance matches for escape codes in addition to common
	 * lengths.  This results in LZ matches under 5 pixels that often take only 7-9 bits
	 * to represent overall.
	 *
	 * (3) Use only short literal lengths for escape codes.  This is great because only
	 * long matches will make it through to the default "complex LZ" escape code, where
	 * I do not care too much about being careful about bit representation.
	 *
	 * (4) Only match up to 256 and if I have to emit a match length, emit a literal
	 * Huffman code for 2-256.  Longer matches do not matter and this makes full use of
	 * the statistics.
	 *
	 * (5) To encode distances, an extended "local region" of pixels up to 16 to the
	 * left/right for the current and previous row, and -8 through +8 for the next 7
	 * rows are assigned symbols in a Huffman code, in addition to a bit count encoding
	 * that indicates how many bits the distance contains as well as some of the high bits.
	 *
	 * (6) The most significant bits of the distances are encoded with 1-3 Huffman codes
	 * to further compress the literal distances.
	 *
	 *
	 * The extra (32) escape codes are:
	 *
	 * 256 = "Distance Same as 1st Last"
	 * 257 = "Distance Same as 2nd Last"
	 * 258 = "Distance Same as 3rd Last"
	 * 259 = "Distance Same as 4th Last"
	 * 260 = "Distance = 1"
	 * 261 = "Distance = 3"
	 * 262 = "Distance = 4"
	 * 263 = "Distance = 5"
	 * 264 = "Distance = 6"
	 * 265 = "Distance = (-2, -1)"
	 * 266 = "Distance = (-1, -1)"
	 * 267 = "Distance = (0, -1)"
	 * 268 = "Distance = (1, -1)"
	 * 269 = "Distance = (2, -1)"
	 * 270 = "Length = 2" + ShortDistance code follows
	 * 271 = "Length = 3" + ShortDistance code follows
	 * 272 = "Length = 4" + ShortDistance code follows
	 * 273 = "Length = 5" + ShortDistance code follows
	 * 274 = "Length = 6" + ShortDistance code follows
	 * 275 = "Length = 7" + ShortDistance code follows
	 * 276 = "Length = 8" + ShortDistance code follows
	 * 277 = "Length = 9" + ShortDistance code follows
	 * 278 = Length code + ShortDistance code follows
	 * 279 = "Length = 2" + LongDistance code follows
	 * 280 = "Length = 3" + LongDistance code follows
	 * 281 = "Length = 4" + LongDistance code follows
	 * 282 = "Length = 5" + LongDistance code follows
	 * 283 = "Length = 6" + LongDistance code follows
	 * 284 = "Length = 7" + LongDistance code follows
	 * 285 = "Length = 8" + LongDistance code follows
	 * 286 = "Length = 9" + LongDistance code follows
	 * 287 = Length code + LongDistance code follows
	 *
