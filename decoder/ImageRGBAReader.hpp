/*
 * Game Closure RGBA Decompression
 *
 * The decompressor rebuilds the static Huffman tables generated by the encoder
 * and then iterates over each pixel from upper left to lower right.
 *
 * Where the 2D LZ Exact Match algorithm triggers, it performs LZ decoding.
 * Where the Dominant Color mask is set, it emits a pixel of that color.
 *
 * For the remaining pixels, the BCIF "chaos" metric selects which Huffman
 * tables to use, and filtered pixel values are emitted.  The YUV color data is
 * then reversed to RGB and then the spatial filter is reversed back to the
 * original RGB data.
 *
 * LZ and alpha masking are very cheap decoding operations.  The most expensive
 * per-pixel operation is the static Huffman decoding, which is just a table
 * lookup and some bit twiddling for the majority of decoding.  As a result the
 * decoder is exceptionally fast.  It reaches for the Pareto Frontier.
